Shader típusok

Vertex Shaders: GL_VERTEX_SHADER
Tessellation Control and Evaluation Shaders: GL_TESS_CONTROL_SHADER and GL_TESS_EVALUATION_SHADER. (requires GL 4.0 or ARB_tessellation_shader)

Tessellation is the Vertex Processing stage in the OpenGL rendering pipeline where patches of vertex data 
are subdivided into smaller Primitives. This process is governed by two shader stages and a fixed-function stage.

The Tessellation Control Shader (TCS) is a Shader program written in GLSL. It sits between the Vertex Shader and the Tessellation Evaluation Shader.

The Tessellation Evaluation Shader (TES) is a Shader program written in GLSL that takes the results of a Tessellation 
operation and computes the interpolated positions and other per-vertex data from them. These values are passed on to the next stage in the pipeline.

Geometry Shaders: GL_GEOMETRY_SHADER
Fragment Shaders: GL_FRAGMENT_SHADER
Compute Shaders: GL_COMPUTE_SHADER. (requires GL 4.3 or ARB_compute_shader)
